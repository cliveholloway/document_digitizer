- Create text validation and post-processing rules

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Polish (Days 11-14)

### 3.1 Quality Assurance & Performance
**Day 11-12**
- Build comprehensive validation pipeline
- Add parallel processing for batch operations
- Implement resume/checkpoint functionality
- Memory optimization for large image sets

### 3.2 CLI Enhancement & Output
**Day 13-14**
- Polish CLI interface with better UX
- Create detailed processing reports
- Add multiple output formats and options
- Implement comprehensive error reporting
- Build documentation and usage examples

## Phase 4: Production Ready (Days 15-16)

### 4.1 Testing & Deployment
**Day 15**
- Comprehensive testing with real-world datasets
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Package for distribution (PyPI, standalone executable)
- Create installation and setup documentation

### 4.2 Web UI Planning & Architecture
**Day 16**
- Design web interface architecture
- Plan REST API for CLI backend integration
- Choose modern web stack (React + FastAPI recommended)
- Create technical specifications for web phase

## Technical Stack Recommendations

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.9+** with Poetry for dependency management
- **OpenCV** for image processing and computer vision
- **Pillow (PIL)** for image format handling
- **Tesseract** + custom models for OCR
- **NumPy/SciPy** for image analysis algorithms

### CLI Framework
- **Click** for robust command-line interface
- **Rich** for beautiful progress bars and console output
- **Typer** (alternative) for type-hinted CLI development

### Cloud Services (Optional)
- **Google Cloud Vision** or **AWS Textract** for backup OCR
- **Azure Form Recognizer** for structured document processing

## Key Development Principles

### Leverage Your Perl Expertise
- Apply your pattern matching skills to text processing
- Use your systems integration experience for robust file handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling and edge case management

### Modern Python Practices
- Type hints throughout (building on your strong typing background)
- Comprehensive testing with pytest
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Proper logging and monitoring

### Incremental Development
- Build and test each component independently
- Create sample datasets for continuous validation
- Maintain backwards compatibility as features evolve

## Success Metrics
- **Accuracy**: >95% transcription accuracy on clean handwriting
- **Performance**: Process 100+ image pairs in <10 minutes
- **Reliability**: Handle edge cases gracefully with detailed error reporting
- **Usability**: Single command execution with intelligent defaults

## Daily Development Focus Areas

### Days 1-5: Image Processing Mastery
Focus on getting the computer vision pipeline rock-solid. Your systems expertise will be crucial for handling edge cases and file management.

### Days 6-10: OCR Challenge
This is the most complex part - leverage your pattern matching expertise from Perl for post-processing OCR results.

### Days 11-16: Polish & Production
Apply your quality-focused development approach to create a production-ready tool.

## Recommended Development Approach
Given your expertise and full-time focus:
- **Morning**: Core development on complex algorithms
- **Afternoon**: Testing, integration, and edge case handling  
- **Evening**: Research and planning for next day's challenges

You should have a working end-to-end pipeline by Day 10, with Days 11-16 focused on optimization and production readiness.

## Risk Mitigation
- **OCR Quality**: Multiple OCR engines with fallback options
- **Image Quality**: Robust preprocessing and quality validation
- **Complex Handwriting**: Manual review workflows and correction tools
- **Performance**: Incremental processing with checkpointing
