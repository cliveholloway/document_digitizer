# Example

This repo comes with 4 sample scans (from the project that inspired this). You can stitch them together to see the output, and play with the config values to see what happens by running:

```
python3 -m document_digitizer data/sample_scans output/
```
You might want to do this with these debug settings, to give you some inbsights into the steps
